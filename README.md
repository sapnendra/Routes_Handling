# Node.js EJS Express Project

This project is a culmination of my learning journey with Node.js, EJS, and Express.js. It showcases my understanding of backend development using these technologies, particularly in handling multiple routes and serving dynamic content.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have implemented various functionalities such as:

- **Routing:** Utilized Express.js to define routes for different pages including about, home, and contact.
- **Template Rendering:** Employed EJS (Embedded JavaScript) to dynamically render HTML pages with reusable components.
- **Middleware:** Implemented middleware functions to handle requests before they reach the route handlers, enabling functionalities like logging and error handling.
- **Static File Serving:** Configured Express.js to serve static files such as CSS stylesheets and client-side JavaScript files.
- **Data Handling:** Interacted with data sources such as form submissions and database queries to dynamically generate content.

## File Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

```
project-root/
│
├── public/            # Static files (e.g., CSS, images)
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── images/
│
├── views/             # EJS templates
│   ├── about.ejs
│   ├── contact.ejs
│   └── home.ejs
│
├── routes/            # Route handlers
│   ├── about.js
│   ├── contact.js
│   └── home.js
│
├── app.js             # Express application setup
└── package.json       # Project dependencies and scripts
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the server using `node app.js`.
5. Access the application through your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Learning Points

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:

- **Backend Development:** Understanding the core concepts of server-side scripting and building robust backend systems.
- **Routing:** Learning how to create and manage routes for different pages and functionalities of a web application.
- **Middleware:** Implementing middleware functions to customize request-handling pipelines and add functionalities like logging and error handling.
- **Template Engines:** Exploring EJS as a template engine to generate dynamic HTML content efficiently.
- **Express.js:** Leveraging the power of Express.js framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

This project serves as a testament to my dedication to learning and my ability to apply newfound knowledge to practical projects.
